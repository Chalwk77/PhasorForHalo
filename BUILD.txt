This file is intended to help people inexperienced with C++
and Visual Studio to build Phasor.

What you need:

	1. Visual Studio 2013 or later
	2. Boost (any suitably recent version should do, but I use 1.56.0)
		http://www.boost.org/
		
Extract Boost somewhere, I use E:\dev\boost_1_56_0.

1. 	Launch Visual Studio and then select Launch Visual Studio Command Prompt
	from the TOOLS menu.
2. 	In the newly launched command prompt, change directory to where you 
	extracted boost.
3. 	Execute: .\bootstrap.bat
4.	Execute: .\b2 --toolset=msvc-12.0 -j8 --build-type=complete --prefix=E:\dev\boost_1_56_0
		Note: This will build ALL of boost and this can take awhile. Phasor only requires
		a few boost libraries to be built, but I don't remember them off the top of my head. So
		I just build everything. The -j8 option tells b2 to build using 8 CPU cores.
5. 	While that's building, open Boost.props in a text editor. You'll find it in Phasor's
	root directory.
6.	Change the value of BOOST_PATH match your boost folder (e.g. E:\dev\boost_1_56_0)

		<PropertyGroup Label="UserMacros">
			<BOOST_PATH>E:\dev\boost_1_56_0</BOOST_PATH>
		</PropertyGroup>
		
7. 	Once Boost has finished building (takes about 20 minutes on my i7-4770), Phasor
	should build without issue.
